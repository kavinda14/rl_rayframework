    "# Distributed Synchronous Value Iteration\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to implement both single-core and distributed versions of syncronous value iteration (VI). In particuar, VI will be applied to Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) in order to compute policies that optimize expected infinite horizon discounted cummulative reward. \n",
    "\n",
    "The relevant content about MDPs and VI are in the following course notes from CS533. \n",

    "### Synchronous Value Iteration Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a review of the synchronous value iteration algorithm. The algorithm is iterative and each iteration produces a newly updated value function $V_{new}$ based on the value function from the previous iteration $V_{curr}$. This is done by applying the Bellman backup operator to $V_{curr}$ at each state. That is, \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "V_{new}(s) = \\max_{a\\in A} R(s,a) + \\beta \\sum_{s'\\in S} T(s,a,s') V_{curr}(s')\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $\\beta \\in [0,1)$ is the discount factor, $R$ is the reward function, and $T$ is the transition function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm also maintains the greedy policy $\\pi$ at each iteration, which is based on a one-step look ahead operator: \n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\pi_{curr}(s) = \\arg\\max_{a\\in A} R(s,a) + \\beta \\sum_{s'\\in S} T(s,a,s') V_{curr}(s')\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "After an update we define the Bellman error of that iteration as $\\max_s |V_{new}(s)-V_{curr}(s)|$. In the notes, it is shown that this error allows us to bound the difference between the value function of $\\pi_{curr}$ and the optimal value function $V^{*}$. Thus, a typical stopping condition for VI is to iterate until the Bellman error is below a specified threshold $\\epsilon$. Putting everything together, the overall algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start with $V_{curr}(s) = 0$ for all $s$\n",
    "- error = $\\infty$\n",
    "- While error > $\\epsilon$ \n",
    "    - For each state $s$ \n",
    "        - $V_{new}(s) = \\max_{a\\in A} R(s,a) + \\beta \\sum_{s'\\in S} T(s,a,s') V_{curr}(s')$\n",
    "        - $\\pi_{curr}(s) = \\arg\\max_{a\\in A} R(s,a) + \\beta \\sum_{s'\\in S} T(s,a,s') V_{curr}(s')$\n",
    "    - error = $\\max_s |V_{new}(s)-V_{curr}(s)|$   ;; could do this incrementally      \n",
    "    - $V_{curr} = V_{new}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we refer to this version of VI as synchronous is because it maintains both a current and new value function, where all values of the new value function are computed based on the fixed current value function. That is, each iteration updates all states based on the value function of the previous iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify this first assignment, we have decided to focus on Synchronous VI and to investigate how to best create a distributed implementation using the Ray framework. In particular, a distributed version of Synchronous VI should still produce a sequence of value functions and policies that are equivalent to those that would be produced by a single-core version, but ideally do so much faster. The remainder of this notebook guides you through some of the MDP mechanics and algorithm implementations. The grand finale of this first assignment is a competition where you will try to develop the fasted distributed implementation that you can. "

This is a type of gridworld environment, whose size (number of states) can be controlled by adjusting the grid dimensions. The environment is intended to model the process of navigating a frozen lake, while avoiding falling into holes with the objective of reaching a goal location. \n",

    "\n",
    "- The transition function moves the agent in the expected direction with 0.7 probability, and there is a 0.3 probability of transitioning to one of the other randomly selected directions. \n",

    "## Distributed Synchronous Value Iteration -- Version 1\n",
    "A simple way to distribute Value Iteration would be to implement each iteration by having a each state updated by a distinct worker. That is each state is updated by creating a work to do the Bellman backup for that state and then recording the result. In order to avoid creating an enormous number of workers, the first implementation will only allow a specified number of workers to be active at any time. After each iteration, the main process checks the Bellman error and if it is less than the specified epsilon it terminates. The following diagram demonstrates the architecture of such a system.\n",

    "## Distributed Synchronous VI Competition\n",
    "In this part, you should design and implement your own distributed synchronous VI method based on what you have learned in the previous parts. Your implementation has the following constraints:\n",
    "- It must terminate and return a value function (and corresponding greedy policy) that satisfies the specified Bellman error threshold\n",
    "- It must be iterative in the sense that it produces the same sequence of value functions as non-distributed synchronous value iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "For this part, you should create a stand alone python file named `competition.py`. You can copy the needed functions from this notebook to your file. Your code should contain a main function called `fast_value_iteration` with the following exact signiture: \n",
    "\n",
    "`def fast_value_iteration(env, beta = 0.999, epsilon = 0.01, workers_num = 4)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here epsilon is the Bellman error threshold and worker_num is the maximum number of workers. This function should return policy and value vectors that satsify the Bellman error constraint. \n",
    "\n",
    "To test your code, you should use an exclusive compution node of DevCloud. You can use the `qsub -I -lselect=1` command to connect to a computation node and run your code on it. We may test your programs on problems as large as 100x100 FrozenLake environments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some possible ideas to consider\n",
    "\n",
    "- How should the number of workers be selected and how should states be partitioned across workers?\n",
    "- Are there alternative protocols between the server and workers?\n",
    "- Where are the communication bottlenecks in the system and how might they be improved? "
